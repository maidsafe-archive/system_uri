## Test Instructions

`system_uri` bridges requests for the three major desktop platforms to register URI-scheme handlers and open URIs external through one simple interface. As this only works in tight integration with the system it is running on, this crate doesn't come with unittest but integration test through examples.

To use it with the Mock:
```
cargo build
cargo run --example test
```

## Configuration

If you don't need the FFI-interface, you can disable it by disabeling the `ffi`-feature in your `cargo.toml` like so:

```
[dependencies.system_uri]
version = "*"
default-features = false
```
